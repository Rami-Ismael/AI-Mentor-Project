I don't know if generic support is possible, but each can easily be supported individually.  \r\n\r\nTo make this work we'd need to:\r\n- change the logging to be non test-tube specific. Logging only happens in 2 places (train and validation completion).  \r\n- Each call to log needs to be process-safe. Meaning when using distributed only rank=0 will log.\r\n- the experiment param in Trainer will need to be generalized (signature the same), to take any logger.   \r\n\r\nI think that's all that's needed to add this support.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions and takers for working on this integration?   \r\n@Borda @alok ", "closed_by": {"login": "williamFalcon", "id": 3640001, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAwMDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640001?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon", "html_url": "https://github.com/williamFalcon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/47/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/47/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
