Test_tube data and saved models will be included in the same folder.\r\n- In each experiment, default is to create a new model and trained from scratch (current behavior)\r\n- If user passed in `--continue-training`, model will load the latest model (not necessarily the best model) from the latest version, then create a new experiment version and continue training from there.\r\n- If user passed in `--continue-training--best`, model will load the the best model from the latest version, then create a new experiment version and continue training from there.\r\n- If user passed in `--continue-training(--best) --version=X`, auto load the model from version X and start training.\r\n\r\nIn the end, all the path and dir are determined from only the log_path and name of experiment, and default behavior is the same as of now: \r\n`python train.py --exp_name=exp1 --....`\r\nIf user want to change some hyperparams, or start finetuning, they will only need to add:\r\n`python train.py --exp_name=exp1 --....  --continue-trainig--best --version=x`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nHappy to discuss more, as I am not sure this is suitable for cluster training or not.\r\nI can make a PR if you're interest.", "closed_by": {"login": "williamFalcon", "id": 3640001, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAwMDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640001?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon", "html_url": "https://github.com/williamFalcon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/williamFalcon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/27/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/27/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
